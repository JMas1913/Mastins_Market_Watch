## Overview
This app will be using a Market API from Market Stack to watch the stock market in real-time and allow the user to create a watch list to keep a closer eye on the investments they would like.

The app will be styled in the Mobile-First approach, utilizing a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) structure. All the styling will be accomplished through CSS.
